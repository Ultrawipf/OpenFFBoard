## Target folder

In this folder are subprojects for each hardware target.

* F411RE: FFBoard 1.0
* F407VE: FFBoard 1.2


A subproject should reference the main FFBoard firmware in the parent folder.

More info about how to set up a new target in the [wiki](https://github.com/Ultrawipf/OpenFFBoard/wiki/Setting-up-target-projects).
