### Changes this version:
- Save TMC space vector PWM mode in flash. Should be usually on for BLDC motors if the star point is isolated.
- Allow using the motors flux component to dissipate energy with the TMC4671 instead of the brake resistor. May cause noticable braking in the motor but takes stress off the resistor.
- Axis speed limiter usable and saved in flash.
- Removed unused hall direction flash setting.
