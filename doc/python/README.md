### Python examples and helpers
This folder contains examples for the HID command system and a helper class for windows (openffboard.py).

For the HID FFB example you need to enable the EXT FFB mainclass. 

Check the [commands page](https://github.com/Ultrawipf/OpenFFBoard/wiki/Commands) for more information about the available commands.

hidapi is the preferred api. Install it using `pip install hidapi`.

An older pywinusb example is also available that only works on Windows.
